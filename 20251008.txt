 Exchange for Banking
Vision: Data Dilemma and Solution
Banks face a choice between legacy on-premise systems (control but siloed) and cloud vendor
platforms (scalable but risk lock-in). AI Exchange bridges this divide with secure, federated AI tailored
for financial institutions.
Workflows in Banking
Banking operations like Loan Origination, Trade Settlement, Fraud Detection, KYC/AML Onboarding,
and Payment Reconciliation are workflows (DAG of tasks and decisions). Each function is a User Task
(credit officer approval) or System Task (fraud model check).
AI Exchange Components (Banking Lens)
• Workflow Orchestrator – manages trade, payment, and compliance workflows
• Price Finder – optimizes credit pricing, FX spreads, and risk-based pricing
• Intelligent Router – routes payments, loan applications, or fraud alerts
• Model Registry – catalogs risk, fraud, liquidity, and capital models
• Semantic App Creator – builds loan calculators, compliance checkers
• LLM Interface – conversational access for bankers, auditors, regulators
Federation Across and Within Banks
Intra-bank Federation: Retail, Corporate, Risk, Treasury, and Compliance departments train local
models (fraud, churn, liquidity stress). Only signals move upward; raw data stays siloed.
Inter-bank Federation: Correspondent banks, clearing houses, and regulators exchange signed model
updates for fraud detection, compliance, and risk intelligence.
Model Evaluation and Pricing
ROI-driven pricing for fraud detection, loan default prediction, and compliance. Continuous learning
adapts to fraud patterns, regulations, and market stress. Fair value allocation ensures transparency
and accountability.
Next Steps for Banking
• Fraud & AML Detection – distributed models flag unusual transactions
• Predictive Risk & Compliance – anticipate credit/liquidity stress
• Personalized Banking Services – enable privacy-preserving personalization
• Data Heterogeneity – unify structured, unstructured, and streaming data
• Secure Aggregation – differential privacy + encryption protect PII and transaction
